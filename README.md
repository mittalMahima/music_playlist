# music_playlist
This is a basic project developed using core java concepts .
This project consists of 3 classes:
1. Song class: this class gives a description of what a song consists of ie name and duration.
2. Album class: this class describes the functionality of how a song is being added to an album after checking some constraints and also contains a method to add it in playlist which adds our favourite songs in playlist.

3. Main class: Main class is the foundation of our project in which addSong methods are being called from album class to insert the songs in album and 2 albums are created in same manner. After that addtoPlaylist method is called from Album class to work on playlist. In end our playlist is being played with use of switch case which contains few options like play previous song , current song , end song , quit etc is being performed.
